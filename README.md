# Wideband-White-Noise-Generator
~100 Watt, Wideband (1 Hz to 6 Ghz), White Noise RF Signal Generator. Project is analogue, digital is shit. Project intended for testing and jamming. Intended to have a sweep function. Minimal effort made to eliminate SNR. Project will be made with UML modelling software. Calculations will be on paper. Cannot be bothered using QUCS or KiCad. The programs are shit. Project most probably made using a IMPAT diode and decent oscillator circuits. White Noise may be generated using a Single Feedback Zener Diode. I still need to do some research on White Noise Generation. I cannot be bothered modulating anything. All design should be simple, cheap and making use of High Power Components that do simply what they are mathematically intended to do.
