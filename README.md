# Wideband White Noise Generator
~100 Watt, Wideband (1 Hz to 6 Ghz), White Noise RF Signal Generator, with Sweep function.
- Project is analogue, digital is shit. 
- Project intended for testing and jamming. 
- Minimal effort made to eliminate SNR. 
- Project will be made with this free tool (buisness went defunct) http://www.spectrum-soft.com/index.shtm
- Calculations will be on paper. QUCS and KiCad are shit.

Project most probably made using a IMPAT diode and decent oscillator circuits. White Noise may be generated using a Single Feedback Zener Diode. I still need to do some research on White Noise Generation. I cannot be bothered modulating anything. All design should be simple, cheap and making use of High Power Components that do simply what they are mathematically intended to do.
